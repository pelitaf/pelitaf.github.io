<h1>Overview</h1>
I've noticed for upper level classes we do not have much tutoring resources readily available. With this website application, it would be a page where students can find tutors that specilizes in certain courses, their rates, and availability. Individuals can also sign up to become a tutor. To ensure that the individual can sign up to be a tutor for said subject, they must verify that they have taken that course/subject and passed. Students will be allowed to leave reviews for tutors.
