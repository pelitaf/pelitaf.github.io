<h1>Overview</h1>
One thing I've experienced as a student in UH Manoa is that there is not as much resources for 300+ level courses. With this website application, it would be a page where students can find tutors that specilizes in certain courses, their rates(if applicable), and availability. Individuals can also sign up to become a tutor. Ideally, I want this page to be a hub of resources so I will also have a page that acts like a forum where students can post outside resources that may have helped them and links to existing discords to help them connect with other students that may have the similar problems/questions. 

<h1>MockUp Page Ideas</h1>

<h3>Landing Page</h3>
<p>The landing page would have a Nav Bar at the top in which the left side would have tabs consisting of "About Us", "Tutors", and "Free Sources Forum." On the right of the nav bar would be a log-in and sign-up button. At the bottom, the footer would have links to contact us and to report issues. The main image would be the UH symbol.</p>

<h4>About Us</h4>
<p>The about us page would have quick information about the purpose of this site and how to navigate through the site.</p>

<h4>Tutors/h4>
<p>The dropdown of this tab would have a link to "Connect with a Tutor." This page would list courses that have tutors available. By clicking the course it would take you to a page that lists the tutors and how to contact them, their availability, reviews, and rates (if applicable) when viewing their views, there will be a button that will allow students to leave a review. </p>

<h4>Free Sources Forum</h4>
