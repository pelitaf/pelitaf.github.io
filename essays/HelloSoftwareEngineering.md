<h2>"Hello World"</h2>
<p>Hello world of software engineering! A world of endless possibilities and outcomes. Everything I have studied up until this point has barely even prepared me for the work needed to be done. Taking my first software engineering class I honeslty did not know what to expect. Every class so far has just been going over basic coding in different languages and on different IDE's. Every day was filled with new challenges, lessons to be learned, and skills to gain.</p>

<h3>Finding My Niche</h3>
<p>Personally, when I first started this class I figured it would be more focused on back-end design and coding. Truthfully, that didn't excite me much. Though after the first half of the semester, we started to get into UI Frameworks. UI Frameworks has been one of my favorite topics to learn about and has given me clarity on what I would want to do after finishing school. UI Frameworks are designed to make application design easy and consistent through different browsers and devices. In this class specifically, we used React-Bootstrap. Using a framework saves you so much time compared to trying to develop a web page completely from scratch. React-Bootstrap did give me a great introduction into what is a UI Framework and how to use them. In terms of using these skills and knowledge outside of class, I plan on working on side projects with React-Bootstrap to better hone my skills.</p>

<h3>Team Work</h3>
<p>Before this class, almost everything we did for any computer science class was done as an individual assignment.</p>
