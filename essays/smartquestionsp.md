How does one go about getting the help they need as a software engineer? In a time where a multitude of resources are readily available with a simple search, knowing how to get the answer you need is crucial. When troubleshooting and/or looking for more information on a problem, its best to be as concise as possible and ensure that you are trying to exhaust any and all information that is already available to you. 

Try different approaches to your problem and check your syntax to make sure its not a small overlooked error.
Do not hesitate to reach out to a friend who may know how to solve your problem. 
Make sure the question has not already been asked.

By doing so, you can save yourself time and get the help you need to get your project done.

After looking at some questions on StackOverflow, here are two that stuck out to me.

What is the '-->' operator in C/C++? - Stack Overflow
In this question, the user is asking what the “-->” operator in C/C++ does. 
The user gave this code:
int main()
{
    int x = 10;
    while (x --> 0) // x goes to 0
    {
        printf("%d ", x);
    }
}

After looking through this thread, I have noticed that some of the answers are sarcastic and unhelpful. Others, who have tried to help agrees on the basic claim that it counts down to 0 in this situation, which is already stated as commented in the code. The rest of the discourse is other users arguing about why is does that, what is an equivalent code, and whether it is or is not ethical to use it. Overall, the original poster has gotten many answers but I would not think they got the exact answer they were looking for either. 
The second question that stuck out to me was: Why does HTML think “chucknorris” is a color?
In this question’s thread, the answers given are concise and in-depth explanations, while many agree on the same reasoning. Each answer may vary in the way they explain via their visuals but are all still helpful in answering the question.
