## Designs

<p>Designs patterns are used in many ways that can help your coding become more efficient. In software engineering, design patterns are reusable solutions to common problems in software design. By creating and using design patterns we are able to reduce the amount of hard coding needed therefore making it easier to scale the project and maintain. In the final project we have been creating in ICS 314, I have come to realize the importance of design patterns. For instance, our final project consists of making an app that lists all of the restaurants in UH Manoa. By making a class of Restaurants, we can use that data and implement a lot of things for our website like our cards to display each one, the pins on the Google Map we are creating, and even adding images.
