Pantry Pals is a web application that I helped create as a team project in ICS 414, Fall 2025. Our team consists of nine members of varying skill level, backgrounds, and work preferences.

Pantry Pals is deployed using [Vercel](https://vercel.com/). Over the course of approximately 5 weeks, we created this website catered to people who frequent the UH Manoa campus who are looking for a place to eat. The website displays restaurants information on the home page. If users create an account they can also "favorite" restaurants and view the ones they have saved. The admin user can edit, delete, and add restaurant information. Vendors can also sign-up to add their restaurant onto our website and can only make edits to their our restaurant.

In order to build this website we used typscript codes and functions, [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/) for our database, and [React-Bootstrap framework](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/) to help make components.

Working on a team to build this application was very insightful as well. We were provided an IDPM(Issue-Driven Project Management) approach that allowed us to organize our tasks and timelines. This helped the team stay on top of things and have clarity of what work is done, still needed, or in progress. For Software Engineering 1 students I am very pleased with our application we have built and can be viewed here at <a href="https://manoa-bites.vercel.app/">Manoa-Bites.vercel.app/</a>.
