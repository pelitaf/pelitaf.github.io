<hr1> Numbers In Ilocano </hr1>

<hr2> Overview: </hr2>

<p> This program was created using C-Language in my ICS 212 class. We were able to choose what language we wanted to translate from and I decided to do Ilocano since this is my parent's native language. 
<br>
The main challenge with developing this program is that the resources I found online to translate higher numbers seemed to have different information. For example, for each values place(i.e. tenths, hundreds, thousands) some websites was showing that you mainly just add "ket" in between each values place translation, while some other resources only added it to the last conjunction of place values. 
<br>
In the future I would like to change this program so that it will ask the user for a number and will tanslate that specific number, rather than print all of the numbers out. In doing so, I would hope this will help me study Ilocano.
