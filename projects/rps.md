# Overview

In my ICS 212 class, I developed this program that simulates the game of rock, paper scissors. My main code set up the game-play to keep running until the user decided to exit the game. I had separate C Files to set up the functions used in the main program which allowed me to set up my code a bit more clearly rather than having all of the code in one file.
I implemented a series of switch cases in order to get the computers play, users play, and game result. In addition to that, I had a random number generator to help with the computers play. Lastly, I implemented a loop that allowed the game to keep going until the user quit.
