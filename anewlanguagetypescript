Walking into my first 300 level computer science course, I honestly did not know what to expect. I did not expect to be having to learn a whole new programming language. In ICS 111 and 211 we focused on Java. ICS 212 we focused mainly on C and was slightly introduced to using the command line. C language was similar enough to Java that the transition wasn’t rough. Though, after sitting in my first ICS 314 class and learning that we will be learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and TypeScript, I immediately became overwhelmed.

“What do you mean we’re going to learn all these languages? Why would they make use learn Java and C in our lower-level classes if we were never going to use them again?” I felt like the system was setting me up for failure. Though the more I started learning TypeScript the more I realized it’s not much different than Java or C language. For the most part, its slight differences in syntax and how to setup properties/methods. 
The biggest thing I appreciate with TypeScript is that I feel as if it gives more valuable feedback when there are errors in your code. When running Java or C, the compiler will tell me what line the error is in but often if you don’t immediately know what’s wrong with the code, the message it gives back does not help much either. However, when I use TypeScript it will specifically tell me that a line of code isn’t working because the string variable cannot be assigned a Boolean value.

On top of learning TypeScript, having to do timed “WODs” in class also stress me out. Being that I’m entirely new to TypeScript, knowing I have to try and produce a code under a certain amount of time is something I know I will struggle with. For example, when I tried the practice WOD’s I felt like I still didn’t have enough knowledge to produce a code that will run efficiently and is more concise. I’m hopeful that as more time passes in the course I will become more proficient in producing TypeScript code. Regardless of the stress and anxiety these come with, I know this practice will help prepare me for success in this field.
